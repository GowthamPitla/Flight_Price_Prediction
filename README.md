# Flight Fare Prediction - a Classic Time Series Project
* Flight fare prediction is a classical problem of time series forecasting that finds trends in past observations to outline the future
* Many popular flight booking websites today, including Google Flights, showcase important insights on:
  * Current fair status: high, low or fair
  * Past fare trends, upcoming future trends and 
  * Helps decide the right time to book a flight ticket.
* In this project, we are going to build a Python Flight Fare Prediction App, that returns the fare prediction for a given set of travel details, like:  departure date, arrival date, departure city, arrival city, stoppages, and the airline carrier.
